// This file is meant to be used on an Arduino Pro Mini 5v or 3.3v
// This following program will be used to monitor Ignition Position and either Boot or Shutdown the Raspberry Pi 
// The Arduino Pro Mini can be set into a "Powered Down State" that requires only a few ÂµA to run in this state
// There are a couple physical alterations that need to be done to the Arduino for the board to use so little amperage which can be found here : http://www.home-automation-community.com/arduino-low-power-how-to-run-atmega328p-for-a-year-on-coin-cell-battery/
// You will need an external library which can be found here: https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power
// The library can also be found through manage libraries in the Arduino Desktop Program (you will need to add it manually)
